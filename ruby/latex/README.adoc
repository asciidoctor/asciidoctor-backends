== Purpose

The aim of `latex_converter` is to transform an Asciidoc
document containing mathematics into a LaTeX document.
Please see the file [red]#manual.ad# 
in this repository for a more details than presented 
here.

Latex_converter supports two closely-related math formats, [blue]#asciimath#
and [blue]#LaTeX#. With the latex_converter you can render expressions
such as stem:[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 ] and

[stem]
++++
 e^{2\pi \sqrt{-1}} = 1
++++
within an Asciidoc file.

(The above won't render properly on github right now, but
will render if this README is run through asciidoctor).


=== Asciimath syntax

Asciimath syntax is
as in
----
    stem:[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 ]
----

and

----
    [stem]
    ++++
      e^{2\pi \sqrt{-1}} = 1
    ++++
----
These are for inline and display math, respectively
The math content is written in LaTeX.
To activitate asciimath
processing, set [blue]#+:stem:+# or [blue]#+:stem: latexmath+#. 

=== LaTeX syntax

The syntax is standard LaTeX:

----
    $ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $
----

and

----
    \[ 
      e^{2\pi \sqrt{-1}} = 1 
    \]
----


== Usage

The command

[source]
--
$ asciidoctor -r ./latex_converter.rb -b latex sample1.adoc 
--

will create a file `sample1.tex` from `sample1.adoc`.
Then `sample1.tex` can be run through +pdflatex+. 
For a more complex example with a lot of math, 
see the file `elliptic.ad` in this repo.
The HTML is rendered at  http://epsilon.my.noteshare.io/notebook/195/?note=782[noteshare.io] for purposes of comparison.


== Files

=== Code

* Ruby
** `latex_converter.rb` -- the driver program to transform asciidoc files to tex files
** `node_processor.rb`-- extends classes in the Asciidoctor module which translate
  Asciidoc elements to TeX elements
** `tex_block.rb` -- strips enclosing escaped braces as needed.
* TeX
** `preamble,tex` -- needed by latex_converter.rb to write a standara LaTeX preamble
** `asciidoc_macros.tex` -- needed to carry out the translation of Asciidoc
   blocks to LaTeX environments
** `macros.tex` -- user macros


=== Test

* `manual.ad` -- describes which elments of Asciidoctor are translated into LaTeX
* `sample1.ad` -- math in conventonal LaTeX form, `$ ... $`, etc.
* `sample2.ad` -- like sample1, but the math is as in `stem:[a^ + b^2 = c^2]`, etc.
* `elliptic.ad`
* `algebraic_varieties.ad` -- a draft, very rough, but
more like a real math article.

One should use all four files in testing the code.

== Coverage

=== Asciidoc

The following constructs are among the those handled by `latex_converter.rb` at this time.  Please see `manual.ad` for a complete list.


. Sections through level 5

. Numbered and un-numbered lists, including nested lists.

. Hyperlinks, e.g. `http::asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor]`.
  
. Bold and italic text

. Hard break: line with trailing `+`


. Roles.  Each role wich is translated into TeX require an entry in the  `asciidoc_tex_macros` file.  For example, the role `[red]`
[red]#which you see in use here# has the entry 
`\newcommand{\rolered}[1]{ \textcolor{red}{#1} }`.






=== LaTeX

A construct like the equation environment,
----
    \[ 
	    \begin{equation} 
		... 
	    \end{equation} 
   \]
---- 
needs to be transformed to ----
---- 
	    \begin{equation} 
		... 
	    \end{equation} 
---- 
There is a tricky point here.  Environments
like the equation environment live outside
of the delimiters `\[ ... \]`. But others live inside. Those
that live outside in LaTeX must have their deliimiters
stripped.  The needed transformation
is given by `TeXBlock.process_environments` in
the file `tex_block.rb`. 


The TeXBlock package addresses the points made
above in the case of both conventional LaTeX syntax
 and the `[stem]` block
syntax.

=== LaTeX Environments

The converter transforms open blocks into 
LaTeX environments.  Thus the source
text

----
.Comment
[[foobar]]
--
This is merely a test.
--
----

is mapped to

----
\begin{Comment}
\label{foobar}
This is merely a test.
\end{Comment}
----

If an identifier as in `[[foobar]]` is not specified,
then a label is generated automatically, as in the
example below:

----
.Comment
--
This is merely a test.
--
----

is mapped to

----
\begin{Comment}
\label{comment:13}
This is merely a test.
\end{Comment}
----

In this case the "13" means that this
was the 13th unlabeled comment.

The converter has little knowlege of LaTeX, so
it compiles a file of dumb definitions of environments
corresponding to the open blocks it encounters, e.g.,

----
\newtheorem{Comment}{Comment}
----

These definitions are found in the file `new_environments.tex`.
The definition  above has no necessary connection with
theorem-proving, but it does provide an easy
way to define a serviceable environment: "Comment"
is in bold, and it is followed by an automatically
generated number.  The body of the block is italicized.
The user will likely want to replace theses environment
definitions better suited to the task at hand.



=== Issues


. The following symbols need to be passed through unchanged

** +--+
** +<+ 
** +>+
** +&+ -- important for typesettig matrices
** +...+ -- horizontal rule


. Some apostrophes and quotes are bad -- they get
translated as +&#1234;+ and TeX chokes on them.
